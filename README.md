# CPArti: Artix-7 FPGA Development Board

A fairly low-cost 4-layer AMD/Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA development board with bidirectional and unidirectional high-speed signals, SRAM, DAC and USB-C connection with built-in JTAG programmer. Designed for JLC04161H-7628 layer stackup in KiCad. All available components include JLCPCB parts numbers for assembly. The project includes [KiBot](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot) configuration for documentation and production files generation automation.

The development board includes:
- Artix-7 FPGA
- USB-C connection to the FPGA via FTDI USB to JTAG (no need for additional programmer) + optional JTAG for a programmer (in case of USB connection failure)
- 2 unidirectional input and 3 unidirectional output SMA connections to FPGA
- 1 direct bidirectional SMA connections to FPGA
- 2 switched bidirectional SMA connections to a single FPGA pin (controlled from FPGA)
- additional SRAM (4Mb)
- high-speed DAC and op-amp for waveform generation implementation
- separate programmable delay line (delay value selected via DIP switches)
- 24 MHz FPGA clock
- 8-digit 7-segment (+ decimal point) displays with MAX7219 display driver
- 14 programmable LEDs
- 8 programmable push buttons (deglitched)
- 8 programmable slide switched
- powered via USB-C or separate 5.5mm DC barrel jack connector

## FTDI USB to JTAG configuration

The built-in FTDI FT232H chip can be used instead of AMD/Xilinx programmer in Vivado Hardware Manager. The FTDI device needs to be configured using Vivado's `program_ftdi` utility. Refer to the [Programming FTDI Devices for Vivado Hardware Manager Support](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug908-vivado-programming-debugging/Programming-FTDI-Devices-for-Vivado-Hardware-Manager-Support) for details.

## KiBot automation

### JLCPCB.kibot.yaml

The KiBot config to automatically generate production files:
- Gerber files
- drill files
- BOM (Bill of Materials)
- CPL (Component Placement List)

Usage:
```
kibot --schematic "CPArti FPGA dev board.kicad_sch" -c JLCPCB.kibot.yaml JLCPCB
```

### config.kibot.yaml

The KiBot config to automatically verify the design and generate documentation files.
- schematic
- PCB top side
- PCB bottom side
- PCB 3D view

The ERC (Electrical Rules Check) and DRC (Design Rules Check) are performed before each file generation.

Usage:
```
# schematic
kibot --schematic "CPArti FPGA dev board.kicad_sch" -c config.kibot.yaml print_sch

# PCB top & bottom side
kibot --schematic "CPArti FPGA dev board.kicad_sch" -c config.kibot.yaml print_PCB_top print_PCB_bottom

# PCB 3D view
kibot --schematic "CPArti FPGA dev board.kicad_sch" -c config.kibot.yaml 3D_top_view
```

### Hi-speed bidirectional and unidirectional SMA connections

Designed for clock signal phase alignment system
Reference: https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/16/3295

#### Terminations

Terminations are implemented as suggested in [7 Series FPGAs PCB Design Guide (UG483)](https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/ug483_7Series_PCB). PCB cost (and therefore size) optimization is a more important objective than power efficiency. For this reason a Thevenin parallel termination is implemented, since generating a separate VTT=3.3V/2=1.65V would require more space and increase power places complexity.
